## Building more realistic environments for machine learning systems

Welcome to the **WorldsOOp software ecosystem**! Our goal here is to create more realistic environments for machine learning systems to train on and test themselves against. The core motivations for (and design ideas behind) this software stack originate from this open source book: [Worlds Of Observation](https://umbralcalc.github.io/worlds-of-observation/).

_State observation is not easy._

These challenging environments have been designed to reflect the difficulties with handling more realistic datasets, as well as the partial state observability that is nearly always the case when working on problems in the real world.

_Gamified realism for machine learning._

Access to real data for the systems that matter is often restricted. We want to circumvent this barrier to generalisation research into practical ML systems by generating it from environments instead. Nothing replaces a real dataset; but we can always try to emulate how messy it gets while still knowing the ground truth!

## Python API

The **WorldsOOp Python API** can be used to build and train decision-making algorithms in realistic simulation environments.

## Environments

We are working on a range of enviroments to train algorithms on.
